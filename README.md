# wallpaper-changer

So I was digging through my "coding stuff" folder and I found this! Completely forgot that I ever made this until now. Because I'm actually putting it on the internet I did change the icon to something original and not copyrighted, and removed my old name from it (meaning it has to be over a year old).

It's a C# wallpaper changer for Windows that supports multiple monitors, so it should put different pictures on different monitors. All you have to do is point it at a folder full of wallpapers and it'll set things automatically. You can change how often it will set a new wallpaper, or use the taskbar icon thingy to change the wallpaper manually.
